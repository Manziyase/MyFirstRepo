One of the most valuable things I've learned so far in this course is how to use Git and GitHub to manage code and collaborate on projects. I now understand how to create repositories, fork projects, clone them locally, and make commits with meaningful messages. These tools are essential for working in teams, tracking progress, and contributing to open-source projects. I'm gaining confidence in using the terminal and writing code in a structured, professional way.
