Brief Introduction About Myself
My name is Manziyase Thierry. I'm a resilient, compassionate, and visionary person who sees challenges as opportunities to grow. My academic background has shaped me into a disciplined and curious learner,
especially in leadership and community development. Over time, I’ve developed a strong interest in business, particularly in how innovative thinking and teamwork can solve 
real-world problems and create a sustainable impact. I’m motivated by a desire to make a difference in my community, and I believe that through this business program, I will
gain the skills, global perspective, and professional network needed to turn my ideas into practical solutions that empower others and drive meaningful change.
