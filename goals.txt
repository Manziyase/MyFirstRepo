My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year

Personal Goals:
In the next year, I aim to grow both in character and capacity. I want to become more disciplined with my time, building a daily routine that supports both my mental well-being and personal development. I plan to dedicate more time to reading and self-reflection, focusing on personal growth areas such as emotional intelligence, empathy, and resilience. Additionally, I hope to strengthen relationships with family and friends, offering consistent support and presence in their lives.

Academic Goals:
Academically, I am determined to deepen my understanding of technology and innovation. My top priority is to complete my current tech-related courses with excellence, especially in areas like programming, data analysis, and business development. I plan to pursue certification or hands-on experience in Salesforce or full-stack web development, aiming to build real-world projects that demonstrate my skills. I also intend to participate in knowledge-sharing forums, competitions, or research groups to improve my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.
